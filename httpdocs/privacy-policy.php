    <h2>Greenleaf Market’S PRIVACY POLICY (VERSION 1.0)</h2>
    <p>THE SHORT VERSION
        We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.
        Some 3rd parties like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. We can't control them but we don't believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.
        If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we'll never share it with others without your express permission.
        We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.
        These are just key points. If you need detail keep reading.
        MEASURING OUR VISITORS
        We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don't know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

        The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

        You can learn more about Google Analytics here or opt out if by visiting this link.

        FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS
        These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.

        To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you're logged in; for example Facebook use this to say "x of your friends like this". We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.

        Social networks therefore could know that you are viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn't to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.

        EMAILS
        We may send you email notifications regarding your service (such as dealer updates) or which you have specifically requested (such as newsletters). You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time.

        We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver our own services, as detailed above.

        SECURITY
        Greenleaf Market take many precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. These precautions include:

        Use of SSL encryption for sensitive data
        Hardware stored in secured datacentres behind firewalls
        All access to information restricted by password and/or secure key
        Restrictions to what information can be accessed via any location
        Whilst we take great care to ensure any confidential information remains protected we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.

        Of course you are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. Nobody at Greenleaf Market will ever ask you for your password, so please don't trust anybody asking you for it.

        UPDATES TO THIS POLICY
        We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. You can always check this page for the latest version. We may also notify you of changes to our privacy policy by email.
